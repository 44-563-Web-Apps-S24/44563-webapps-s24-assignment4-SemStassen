        On foot, young man. I've been to Tihon of the Don, and I'm going to the
        Holy Hills.

        From there, if God wills it, to Odessa.... They say you can get to
        Jerusalem cheap from there, for twenty-ones roubles, they say....

      <h4>FEDYA.</h4>
      <p>And have you been to Moscow?</p>
      <h4>SAVVA.</h4>
      <p>Rather! Five times....</p>
      <h4>FEDYA.</h4>
      <p>Is it a good town?</p>
      <p>[Smokes]</p>
      <p>
        Well-standing? Sews. There are many holy places there, young man....
        Where there are many holy places it's always a good town....

      <p>Once more, please! For the sake of Christ, give it to me!</p>
